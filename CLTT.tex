\subsection{Fibrations}

\begin{exo}[]
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item Prove the following proposition:

        Cartesian liftings are unique up-to-isomorphism (in a slice): if $f$ and $f'$ with $\cod f =
        \cod f'$ are both Cartesian over the same map, then there is a unique vertical isomorphism
        $\varphi : X \overset{\cong}{\to} X'$ with $f'\circ\varphi = f$.
        \item Suppose $f$ is Cartesian and $g$ and $h$ are above the same map. Show that $f\circ g = f
        \circ h$ implies $g = h$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{exo}

\begin{answer}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item Let $f : X \to Y$ and $f' : X' \to Y$ in $\bE$ be both Cartesian over a map $u : pX \to
        pY$. Then as $f$ is Cartesian, there is a unique $\psi : X' \to X$ such that $f' =\psi \circ 
        f$ and as $f'$ is cartesian, there is a unique $\varphi : X \to X'$ such that $f = \varphi
        \circ f'$. We claim that $\psi = \varphi ^{-1}$. Indeed, the composite $\varphi\circ \psi$
        is such that $f'\circ (\varphi\circ\psi) = f' = f'\circ \idd$, so by uniqueness of the arrow
        $h$ such that $f' = f'\circ h$, we deduce that $\varphi\circ\psi = \idd$. Similarly, for
        $\psi\circ\varphi$, we have that $f\circ(\psi\circ\varphi) = f$, thus $\psi\circ\varphi =
        \idd$. This means that $\varphi : X \overset{\cong}{\to} X'$ is such that $f'\circ \varphi = f$
        and is unique by uniqueness of the definition of $\varphi$. The fact that $\varphi$ is vertical
        is because we used Cartesianness of $f$ (resp $f'$) on the functions $u,u,\idd$, so
        $p(\varphi) = \idd$.
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd}
                \bE\ar[ddd,"p"] & & X \ar[dd,bend left,dashed,"\varphi"] \ar[rrd,"f"] & & \\
                & & & & Y\\
                & & X' \ar[uu,bend left, dashed, "\psi"] \ar[rru, "f'"] & \\
                \bB & & I \ar[rr,"u"] & & J
            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center}
        \item Let $f : X \to Y$ be Cartesian and $g,h : Z \to X$ above the same map. Suppose that
        $f\circ g = f\circ h$.
        Then, if we write $t = f\circ g$ (which is also $f\circ h$), we have that $g$ and $h$ both
        complete the triangle below:
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd}
                \bE\ar[ddd,"p"] & & & X \ar[r,"f"] & Y\\
                & & Z\ar[ur,"g",shift left = 1ex]\ar[ur,"h" below,shift right = 1ex] 
                \ar[urr,bend right,"t" below]\\
                & & & J \ar[r,"u"]& I \\
                \bB & & L\ar[ur,"w"]\ar[urr,"v" below, bend right] & & 
            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center}
        But $f$ being cartesian, there can be only one such arrow, so $g = h$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{answer}

\begin{exo}
    Let $p : \bE\to\bB$ be a functor; assume $f : X \to Y$ is in $\bE$ and put $u = pf$. Show that $f$
    is Cartesian if and only if for each $Z \in \bE$ and $v : pZ\to pX$ in $\bB$, the function
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}
            \bE_v\big(Z,X\big) \ar[rr,"f\;\circ\;(-)"] & & \bE_{u\circ v} \big(Z,Y\big)
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    is an isomorphism.
\end{exo}

\begin{answer}
    Suppose that for all $Z\in \bE$ and $v : pZ\to pX$ in $\bB$, $f\circ(-)$ is an isomorphism between
    $\bE_v(Z,X)$ and $\bE_{u\circ v}(Z,Y)$, let's show that $f$ is Cartesian. Let $g : Z \to X$ be an arrow in
    $\bE$, and $w : pZ \to pX$ be an arrow in $\bB$ such that $pg = pf\circ w$. The fact that $f$ is Cartesian
    means that there is one and only one arrow $h : Z \to X$ above $w$ such that $g = f\circ h$, which is
    exactly the fact that $f\circ(-)$ is a bijection from $\bE_{w}(Z,X)$ to $\bE_{u\circ w}(Z,Y)$.

    Conversely, if $f$ is Cartesian, let $Z \in \bE$ and $v : pZ \to pX$ in $\bB$. Let $g \in \bE_{u\circ v}
    (Z,Y)$, the only $h\in \bE_v(Z,X)$ such that $f\circ h = g$ is exactly the one given by the universal
    property of $f$ being Cartesian.
\end{answer}

\begin{exo}
    Consider the total category of a fibration. Show that
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item every morphism factors as a vertical map followed (diagrammatically) by a Cartesian one;
        \item\label{1.1.1.3.ii} a Cartesian map above an isomorphism is an isomorphism. Especially a
        vertical Cartesian map is an isomorphism.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{exo}

\begin{answer}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item Let $X,Y\in\bE$ and $f : X \to Y$. As $pf : pX\to pY$ and $p$ is a fibration, we can lift
        $pf$ in a function $h : Z \to Y$ which is Cartesian. As $h$ is Cartesian and $pf = pf\circ\idd$,
        there exists one and only one function $g : Z \to X$ above $\idd$ such that $f = h \circ g$. Thus,
        $f$ factors as a vertical map followed by a Cartesian one.
        \item Let $f : X \to Y$ be above an isomorphism $u : I \to J$ and be Cartesian. As $u$ is an
        isomorphism, let $v = u^{-1} : J \to I$. We know that $\idd = u\circ v$ so, as $f$ is Cartesian, there
        exists one and only one $g : Y \to X$ above $u$ such that $\idd = f \circ g$. We want to show that
        $g\circ f = \idd$, but as $f\circ (g\circ f) = f = f \circ \idd$, and both $\idd$ and $g\circ f$ are
        vertical, this means by uniqueness that $g\circ f = \idd$, so $g =f^{-1}$.

            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{answer}

\begin{exo}
    Let $\fibPEB$ be a fibration. Prove that
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item all isomorphisms in $\bE$ are Cartesian;
        \item\label{1.1.1.4.ii} if $\overset{f}{\rightarrow}\overset{g}{\rightarrow}$ is a composable
        pair of Cartesian morphisms in $\bE$, then also their composite $\overset{g\circ f}{\rightarrow}$ is Cartesian.
    \end{enumerate}
    Hence it makes sense to talk about the subcategory $\Cart(\bE)\hookrightarrow\bE$ having
    all objects from $\bE$ but only the Cartesian arrows. We write $|p|$ for the composite
    $\Cart(\bE)\hookrightarrow\bE \rightarrow \bB$.
    \setlist[enumerate]{resume}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item\label{1.1.1.4.iii} Let $\overset{f}{\to}\overset{g}{\to}$ be a composable pair in $\bE$
        again. Show now that if $g$ and $g\circ f$ are Cartesian, then $f$ is Cartesian as well.
        \item Verify that a consequence of \ref{1.1.1.4.iii} is that the functor $|p| : \Cart(\bE) \to
        \bB$ is a fibration. From \ref{1.1.1.3.ii} in the previous exercise it follows that all
        fibres of $|p|$ are groupoids (\textit{i.e.} that all maps in the fibres are isomorphisms).
    \end{enumerate}
    [This $|p|$ will be called the \textbf{fibration of objects of} $p$.]
\end{exo}

\begin{answer}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
        \item This directly follows from the characterization of $f$ being Cartesian if and only if $(-)\circ
        f$ is an isomorphism between functions over given arrows.
        \item Let $\xrightarrow f \xrightarrow g$ be a composable pair of Cartesian morphisms in $\bE$.
        Let's show that $g\circ f$ is Cartesian. We state $f : X \to Y$ and $g : Y \to Z$. Let
        $h : A \to Z$ and $w : pA \to pX$ such that $ph = pg\circ pf \circ w$, let's show that there exists
        one and only one $k : A \to X$ such that $h = g \circ f \circ k$. First, using the fact that $g$ is
        Cartesian on $h$ and $pf\circ w$, there is only one $h' : A \to Y$ such that $ph' = pf \circ w$ and
        $g\circ h' = h$. Know, using the fact that $f$ is Cartesian with $ph' = pf\circ w$, we find that there
        exists one and only one $k : A \to X$ such that $pk = w$ and $h' = f\circ k$, so there exists one and
        only one $k$ such that $g\circ h' = g\circ f \circ k$, \textit{i.e.} such that $h = g\circ g \circ k$.
        So $g\circ f$ is Cartesian.
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd}
                \bE\ar[dddd,"p"] & & A\ar[dr,dashed,"k"] \ar[drr,"h'" near end, dashed, bend left = 10]
                \ar[drrr,"h",bend left=15] & & &\\
                & & & X\ar[r,"f"] & Y\ar[r,"g"] & Z \\
                \\
                & & pA\ar[dr,"w"] \ar[drrr,"ph", bend left=15]\\
                \bB & & & pX\ar[r,"pf"] & pY\ar[r,"pg"] & pZ
            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center}
        \item Suppose that $g$ and $g\circ f$ are Cartesian, let's prove that $f$ is Cartesian. Suppose that
        $f : X \to Y$, $g : Y \to Z$ and that we have $h : A \to Y$ and $w : pA \to pX$ such that
        $ph = pf \circ w$, let's prove that there exists a unique $k : X \to A$ such that $pk = w$ and
        $h = f\circ k$. First, as $g$ is Cartesian, $h$ is the only arrow above $ph$ such that $g\circ h =
        g\circ h$. Thus the condition on $k$ is equivalent to the condition that $g\circ f\circ k = g\circ h$
        and that $k$ is above $w$. But then, we use the fact that $g\circ f$ is Cartesian to deduce that
        there is only one such $k$. Thus, $f$ is Cartesian.
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd}
                \bE\ar[dddd,"p"] & & A\ar[dr,dashed,"k"] \ar[drr,"h" near end, bend left = 10]
                \ar[drrr,"g\circ h", bend left = 15]& & &\\
                & & & X\ar[r,"f"] & Y\ar[r,"g"] & Z \\
                \\
                & & pA\ar[dr,"w"] \ar[drr,"ph" near end, bend left=10]\ar[drrr,"p(g\circ h)", bend left=15]\\
                \bB & & & pX\ar[r,"pf"] & pY\ar[r,"pg"] & pZ
            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center}
        \item Let's check that $|p|$ is indeed a fibration. Let $X \in \bE$, $I\in\bB$ and $u : I \to pX$.
        As $p$ is a fibration, we can find a Cartesian morphism $f : Y \to X$ in $\bE$ such that $pf = u$.
        By definition, $f \in \Cart(\bE)$, so we just need to check that $f$ is Cartesian inside $\Cart(\bE)$,
        but this is straightforward. All fibres of $|p|$ being groupoids is due to the fact that they are
        Cartesian morphisms above $\idd$, which is an isomorphism, and hence are themselves isomorphisms.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{answer}

\begin{exo}
    Verify that the following two results---known as the Pullback Lemmas--- are a consequence of 
    \ref{1.1.1.4.ii} and \ref{1.1.1.4.iii} from the previous exercise. Consider
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If $(A)$ and $(B)$ are pullback squares, then the outer rectangle is also a pullback
        square.
        \item If the outer rectangle and $(A)$ are pullback squares, then $(B)$ is a pullback square
        as well.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{exo}

\begin{exo}
    Consider a functor $p : \bE \to \bB$. We describe a slightly weaker notion of Cartesianness, than
    the one above. Call a morphism $f : X \to Y$ in $\bE$ \textbf{weak Cartesian} if for each
    $g : Z \to Y$ with $pf = pg$  there is a unique vertical $g : Z \to X$ in with $f\circ h = g$.
    Show that the functor $p$ is a fibration if and only if both
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item every morphism $u : I \to pY$ in $\bB$ has a weak Cartesian lifting $f : X \to Y$;
        \item the composition of two weak Cartesian morphisms is again weak Cartesian.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{exo}

\begin{exo}
    Check that the following are (trivial) examples of fibrations
    $$\fib{\bB\times\bC}{\mathrm{fst}}{\bB}\qquad \fib{\bB}{\idd}{\bB}\qquad \fib{\bB}{}{1 = \{*\}}
    \qquad \fib{X}{}{I}$$
    where $X,I$ are sets (\textit{i.e.} discrete categories).
\end{exo}

\begin{answer}
    \textbf{First case:} $\fib{\bB\times\bC}{\mathrm{fst}}{\bB}$
    Let $\langle X,Y\rangle \in\bB\times \bC$, $Z \in\bB$, and $u : Z\to X$. We claim that the Cartesian
    lifting of $u$ is $\langle u,\idd_Y\rangle : \langle Z,Y\rangle \to \langle X,Y\rangle$. Indeed, if one
    has $\langle h_1,h_2\rangle : \langle A,B\rangle \to \langle X,Y\rangle$ and $w : A \to Z$ such that
    $u\circ w = h_1$, then a $\langle k,\ell\rangle : \langle A,B\rangle \to \langle Z,Y\rangle$ such that
    $\mathrm{fst}(\langle k,\ell\rangle) = w$ means that $k = w$, and having
    $$\langle u,\idd_Y\rangle \circ \langle k,\ell\rangle = \langle h_1,h_2\rangle$$
    means, by projection on the second coordinates, that $\ell = h_2$. So the only candidate (and it obviously
    works) is the arrow $\langle w,h_2\rangle$.
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&]
            {\bB\times\bC} \&\& {\langle A,B\rangle} \\
            \&\&\& {\langle Z,Y\rangle} \&\& {\langle X,Y\rangle} \\
            \\
            \&\& A \\
            {\bB} \&\&\& Z \&\& X
            \arrow["{\mathrm{fst}}", from=1-1, to=5-1]
            \arrow["{\langle u,\idd_Y\rangle}", from=2-4, to=2-6]
            \arrow["{\langle h_1,h_2\rangle}"' above, from=1-3, to=2-6, bend left = 15]
            \arrow["{\langle k,\ell\rangle}", from=1-3, to=2-4]
            \arrow["k", from=4-3, to=5-4]
            \arrow["{h_1}"' above, from=4-3, to=5-6, bend left = 15]
            \arrow["u", from=5-4, to=5-6]
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}

    \textbf{Second case:} $\fib{\bB}{\idd}{\bB}$ Let $X \in \bB$, $Y \in \bB$ and $u : Y \to X$. Its Cartesian
    lifting is itself: if we have a triangle below that commutes, then it can only be lifted to itself as
    the functor is the identity.

    \textbf{Third case:} $\fib{\bB}{}{\{*\}}$ Let $X \in \bB$, $* \in 1$. The only arrow in $1$ is the
    identity of the sole object, and we can take as Cartesian lifting of $\idd_*$ the arrow $\idd_X$. The
    fact that it is Cartesian is because it is an isomorphism.

    \textbf{Fourth case:} $\fib{X}{}{I}$ where $X$ and $I$ are discrete categories. Here too, the only
    possible arrows are identities, which can be lifted directly be an identity on the above object, which
    is Cartesian because it is an isomorphism.

    For an arbitrary category $\bB$, consider the domain functor $\dom : \bB^\rightarrow \to \bB$.

            that $\langle h_1,h_2\rangle = \langle u,\idd_Y\rangle \circ \langle t,u\rangle$ is
            $\langle \beta,h_2\rangle$. This is direct, as being above $\beta$ means that $t = \beta$, and
            the other equality amounts to $h_2 = \beta$. Thus this lifting is Cartesian. This shows that
            $\dom : \bB^\to\to\bB$ is a fibration.
            \item Let's show that $\dom_I$ is a fibration. Let $\fib{X}{f}{I} \in \bB/I$, $Y\in \bB$ and
            $u : Y \to X$. A Cartesian lifting is given by
            $$u : \fib{Y}{f\circ u}{I}\longrightarrow \fib{X}{f}{I}$$
            and the proof that this lifting is Cartesian is the same as in the previous question.

    For an arbitrary category $\bB$, let $\bB^\to_\bullet$ be the category with \textbf{pointed families}

    $\varphi$ (\textit{i.e.} a map $s : I \to X$ with $\varphi\circ s = \idd$). A morphism $\langle
    \left(\fib{X}{\varphi}{I}\right),s\rangle \longrightarrow \langle \left(\fib{Y}{\psi}{J}\right),t\rangle$
    in $\bB^\to_\bullet$ consists of a pair of morphisms $u : I \to J$, $f : X \to Y$ in $\bB$ with $\psi 
    \circ f = u \circ \varphi$ and also $f \circ s = t \circ u$. Thus morphisms of pointed families preserve
